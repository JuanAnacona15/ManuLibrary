# ManuLibrary

**Description of the app:**
“ManuLibrary is a cloud application designed to facilitate the work in libraries that offer book lending services. The application allows users to visualize the books available in the library and offers the option to request the loan. Users wishing to access the loans must create an account on the platform. Once the loan is made, the user receives an email with the details of the borrowed book and the return date.

---

## App status
Currently, ManuLibrary has the following functionalities:
- **Book viewing:** Users can view the available books that are registered in the database.
- **Account creation:** Users can register a user with basic data such as name, email, password, phone number, grade, among others.
- **Loan simulation:** The application allows the loan of books by indicating the user's document number. Subsequently, an email is sent to the user with the details of the loan, including the date of delivery and the book requested.

## Future Upgrades
In future releases, the following enhancements are planned:
1. **Enhanced book loan security:** User ID and password will be required to ensure data integrity.
2. **Book categorization:** Books will be organized into categories, and each category will be displayed on dedicated subpages.
3. **Password recovery and change:** The option for users to recover and change their passwords will be implemented.
